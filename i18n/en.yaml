    Hi, I'm Ivo! I'm a Lecturer & PhD student at the University of Groningen. 
    I do research on Machine Learning methods with Uncertainty Estimation, and how those may be applied to Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
    <br>

    As a Lecturer I teach in my area of expertise. My teaching is therefore focused on Uncertainty in Machine Learning, Brain-Computer Interfaces and Deep Learning. 
    I enjoy combining my research and teaching when supervising Bachelor and Master thesis projects, or developing hands-on assignments that dive into the technical details of modern AI.

- id: "experience_description"
  translation: "<p class='lead'>I'm interested in how Machine Learning methods behave when subjected to the reality of datasets that are often noisy, sparse or otherwise non-ideal. 
    The research I do on Uncertainty in Machine Learning is therefore largely focused on empirical experiments where data's and algorithms interact. I'm specifically interested in distinguishing between <b>data uncertainty</b> and <b>model uncertainty</b> in Deep Learning.
    <br>
    For Brain-Computer Interfaces I'm interested in applying these Uncertain Machine Learning methods and seeing whether they give meaningful benefits to researcher or users.
    Personally, I'm most interested in Brain-Computer Interfaces when they can be useful for ALS, spinal cord injury, or stroke patients. Through decoding brain signals from movement attempts, I aim to achieve meaningful and useable control of a device. 
    <br>
    I've selected some highlighted papers on the left. All publications are freely available as Open Access, just click the link.
    </p>
    <h3> Collaboration & Supervision</h2>
    <p class='lead'>
    Interesting research comes from sharing interesting ideas, and many of my papers come from supervising excellent students or collaborating with excellent researchers.
    I am currently open to collaborations with:
    </p>

    <ul class='lead'>
      <li> Bachelor or Master students looking to do a research project. 
      <li> Businesses interested in internship projects or with an interesting research problem. 
      <li> Researchers looking to work with (uncertain) Machine Learning or Brain-Computer Interfaces.
      <li> Educators interested in AI.
    </ul>
    <p class='lead'>
    If you're considering working with me, feel free to reach out.
