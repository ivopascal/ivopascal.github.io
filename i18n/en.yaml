    Hi, I'm Ivo! I'm a Lecturer & PhD student at the University of Groningen. 
    I do research on Machine Learning methods with Uncertainty Estimation, and how those may be applied to Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
    <br>

    As a Lecturer I teach in my area of expertise. My teaching is therefore focused on Uncertainty in Machine Learning, Brain-Computer Interfaces and Deep Learning. 
    I enjoy combining my research and teaching when supervising Bachelor and Master thesis projects, or developing hands-on assignments that dive into the technical details of modern AI.

      As a researcher, one of the nice parts of my job is to spread knowledge. 
      This gives me the opportunity to present my research to diverse audiences including researchers, companies, the general public and children.
      I have presented research, given demo's or otherwise engaged with an audience for:
      </p>
      <ul class='lead'>
        <li> Pints of Science - An informal talk about my research on BCIs in a bar.
        <li> CogniGron at Work - A talk about BCIs and the brain and how this relates to CogniGron's expertise: neuromorphic computing. 
        <li> Zpannend Zernike - A demo of a BCI being used in real-time. We informally explain the concepts of a BCI to children and parents to excite them about science, and help them differentiate from science-fiction. Thanks to Bernard Renardi and Andreea Sburlea!
        <li> European Research Night - A science-pitch competition using a silent-disco system. Competitively pitch my research to a general audience while other researchers are telling about their own work. 
        <!-- <li> IMC Weekendschool - A workshop in which we showed 10-14 year old children what the job of <i>scientist</i> can be. We also gave a small workshop on Machine Learning in which the children learned to make their own Machine Leanring model. Thanks to Dagmar Heeg! -->
        <li> Cover Symposium Accountability, Responsiblity and Transparency in AI - A panel discussion on how to make sure AI is developed responsibly with proper governance. 
        <!-- <li> Graz BCI Conference, Cognitive Modelling Group, BCN Retreat, Visit from INCIA PhD students, ... - Exchanging knowledge with other researchers in my area of expertise.  -->
      </ul>
      <p class='lead'>Feel free to invite me to give a talk, demo, or workshop. If I have time, I'd be happy to join!</p>

  translation: "<p class='lead'>I'm interested in how Machine Learning methods behave when subjected to the reality of datasets that are often noisy, sparse or otherwise non-ideal. 
    The research I do on Uncertainty in Machine Learning is therefore largely focused on empirical experiments where data's and algorithms interact. I'm specifically interested in distinguishing between <b>data uncertainty</b> and <b>model uncertainty</b> in Deep Learning.
    <br>
    For Brain-Computer Interfaces I'm interested in applying these Uncertain Machine Learning methods and seeing whether they give meaningful benefits to researcher or users.
    Personally, I'm most interested in Brain-Computer Interfaces when they can be useful for ALS, spinal cord injury, or stroke patients. Through decoding brain signals from movement attempts, I aim to achieve meaningful and useable control of a device. 
    <br>
    I've selected some highlighted papers on the left. All publications are freely available as Open Access, just click the link.
    </p>
    <h3> Collaboration & Supervision</h2>
    <p class='lead'>
    Interesting research comes from sharing interesting ideas, and many of my papers come from supervising excellent students or collaborating with excellent researchers.
    I am currently open to collaborations with:
    </p>

    <ul class='lead'>
      <li> Bachelor or Master students looking to do a research project. 
      <li> Businesses interested in internship projects or with an interesting research problem. 
      <li> Researchers looking to work with (uncertain) Machine Learning or Brain-Computer Interfaces.
      <li> Educators interested in AI.
    </ul>
    <p class='lead'>
    If you're considering working with me, feel free to get in touch. I'd be happy to have a cup of coffee with you!
