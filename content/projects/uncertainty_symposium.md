The Uncertainty in Machine Learning symposium brings together active researchers studying how to identify when Machine Learning systems make mistakes. The event covered both fundamental research and applications in LLMs, Education, Healthcare, Computer Vision, as well as ethical considerations for the safe and responsible deployment of AI. 

The event was recorded, and those recordings are still available. If you're interested, feel free to send me a message and I will share the recordings with you.
